## Getting Started: How to Use This Template

Follow these simple steps to get your own portfolio website up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

**Node.js:** Download and install the latest LTS version from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
**npm** (Node Package Manager): This comes with Node.js.

### Step 1: Get the Code

You have two easy ways to get the template code:

**Option A: Download the Zip File**
    1.  Go to this GitHub page: `https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/your-repo-name` (Remember to replace `YourGitHubUsername/your-repo-name` with the actual link to *your* repository once it's on GitHub!).
    2.  Click the green **`Code`** button.
    3.  Select **`Download ZIP`**.
    4.  Once downloaded, unzip the file to a folder on your computer (e.g., `my-portfolio`).

**Option B: Use Git (Recommended)**
    1.  If you have Git installed, open your terminal or command prompt.
    2.  Run this command:
        ```bash
        git clone [https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/your-repo-name.git)
        ```
        (Again, replace `YourGitHubUsername/your-repo-name` with your actual repository link!)
    3.  This will create a new folder with the template code.

**### Step 2: Open the Project**

Now, navigate into the project folder using your terminal or command prompt:
'''bash
cd your-repo-name
# Or, if you downloaded the zip:
# cd my-portfolio
'''


**Step 3: Install Everything It Needs**
Your template relies on various packages. Install them with one command:
'''bash
    npm install
'''

**Step 4: See Your Website Live (On Your Computer)**
Ready to see your portfolio?

'''Bash
  npm start
  This command starts the development server.
'''

Your default web browser should automatically open to http://localhost:3000. This is your portfolio running locally!
If the browser doesn't open automatically, simply type http://localhost:3000 into your browser's address bar.
Important: Keep the terminal window where npm start is running open. If you close it, your website will stop.

**Step 5: Make It Yours (Customization)**

This is where you personalize the template with your own information.

Open the project folder in your favorite code editor (like VS Code, Atom, or Sublime Text).

Most of the content (your name, about me text, project details, skills, contact info) can be found in the src folder. Look for files like:

src/data/yourData.js (or src/constants/index.js or similar, if you've centralized data).

Individual component files, e.g., src/components/Hero.js, src/components/About.js, src/components/Projects.js, etc.

You'll see clear sections where you can replace placeholder text and image paths with your own.

Instant Updates: As you save changes in your code editor, your website running at http://localhost:3000 will automatically update, so you can see your modifications in real-time!
