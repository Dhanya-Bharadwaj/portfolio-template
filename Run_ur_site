## Technologies Used

* **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** The programming language for web development.
* **HTML5:** For structuring the web content.
* **CSS3:** For styling the web pages (consider mentioning if you used a framework like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap here if applicable).

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Node.js:** [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
* **npm** (Node Package Manager) or **Yarn** (comes with Node.js installation)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
    *(Replace `YourGitHubUsername/your-repo-name.git` with your actual GitHub repository link)*

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

### Running Locally

To start the development server:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start


This will run the app in development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will automatically reload if you make changes.

Customization
This template is designed for easy customization. Here's how you can make it your own:

Changing Content (Text, Images, Links)
Most of the content (text, images, and links) can be found and modified in the following files/directories:

src/data/ (or similar, e.g., src/constants/index.js): Look for a data folder or a file where your personal information, about me text, project details, skill lists, and contact information are stored. These are often structured as JavaScript objects or arrays for easy modification.

src/components/: For text directly embedded in components, you might need to navigate to specific component files (e.g., Hero.js, About.js, Projects.js) and edit the JSX content.

Images: Replace placeholder images in the public/ folder or src/assets/ (depending on your project structure) with your own. Ensure image paths in the code are updated accordingly.

Social Media Links: Update your GitHub, LinkedIn, and email links in the relevant component (likely in the Hero section or Footer).

Tips for specific sections:

Hero Section (src/components/Hero.js or similar):

Change "YOUR NAME" to your actual name.

Update your designation (e.g., "Full Stack Developer").

Modify the introductory paragraph.

Update the links for "View My Work" and "Get In Touch".

About Section (src/components/About.js or similar):

Edit your "About Me" description.

Update experience details, happy clients, and awards (if applicable).

Values Section (src/components/Values.js or similar):

Modify the text to reflect your personal and professional values.

Projects Section (src/components/Projects.js or similar):

Add, remove, or modify project entries. Each project usually has fields for title, description, technologies used, and links to live demo/GitHub repo.

Skills Section (src/components/Skills.js or similar):

Update your skills list, categorizing them if necessary (e.g., Frontend, Backend, Tools).

Contact Section (src/components/Contact.js or similar):

Update your contact email, phone number, and location.

If using a contact form, ensure its submission logic is connected to your backend service (e.g., Formspree, Netlify Forms).

Adding/Removing Sections
The template is modular. To add a new section, create a new React component file in src/components/ and then import and render it in src/App.js (or your main layout component). To remove a section, simply remove its import and rendering from src/App.js.

Styling
src/index.css or src/App.css: For global styles.

Component-specific CSS: Many React projects use CSS modules (e.g., ComponentName.module.css) or styled-components. Look for CSS files alongside your component files.

If using Tailwind CSS: Modify tailwind.config.js and apply utility classes directly in your JSX.

Deployment
You can easily deploy this portfolio template to various hosting platforms. Here are some popular options:

Vercel (Recommended):

Create a Vercel account and connect your GitHub repository.

Vercel automatically detects React projects and deploys them.

Simply push your changes to your main or master branch, and Vercel will redeploy.

Netlify:

Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify.

Set build command to npm run build and publish directory to build.

Netlify will deploy your site on every push.

GitHub Pages:

In your package.json, add a homepage field with your GitHub Pages URL (e.g., "homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name").

Install gh-pages: npm install gh-pages --save-dev.

Add the following scripts to your package.json:

JSON

"scripts": {
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
}
Run npm run deploy to deploy your site.
